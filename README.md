## Description
Student groups will create a comprehensive interactive data analysis and modeling platform that enables users to seamlessly import, clean, visualize, analyze, and model data using scientific calculations and data visualization tools.

The platform will tackle the problem of voice intelligibility in enclosed spaces that can be disruptive to hearing and learning. Large enclosed spaces, if not properly treated, may induce long reverberation times.
